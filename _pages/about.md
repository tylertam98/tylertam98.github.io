Dr. Tan Qichen is an Associate Professor at Soochow University. He earned his BEng in Software Engineering from the <strong>University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC)</strong> in 2020 and completed his PhD in Intelligent Transportation at the <strong>Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST)</strong> in 2024. Prior to joining Soochow University, he continued his research as a post-doctoral fellow at HKUST, deepening his expertise in low-altitude economy and intelligent technologies. Dr. Tan’s research focuses on solving complex challenges at the intersection of technology and sustainability. His work centers on intelligent path planning for low-altitude aircraft, acoustic simulation of aircraft, multimodal data fusion, noise visualization, and embodied artificial intelligence. His innovative approaches aim to create smarter, quieter, and more efficient urban environments. <strong>Dr. Tan warmly invites passionate undergraduate and master’s students to join our vibrant research team. Here, you’ll embark on a transformative journey to expand your global perspective, engage in pioneering scientific exploration, and foster interdisciplinary innovation.</strong>
